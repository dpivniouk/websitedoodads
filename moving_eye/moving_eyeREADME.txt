These snippets can be used together to add an eyeball to your webpage that will track the movement of the cursor. 

The images I've used for this purpose are included but they are not licensed for commercial use and you should create your own.

The parts of the eye can be removed or changed as desired from the HTML and CSS, except for the iris and pupil which are mandatory.

Make sure to update the 'YOURURL' flags with the addresses of your own eyeball images.
